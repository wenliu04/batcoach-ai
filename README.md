# 🏀 BatCoach-AI

BatCoach-AI is a real-time AI-based baseball swing analyzer designed to help kids improve their batting posture using computer vision and pose estimation. Built for NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and optimized for edge deployment.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time pose estimation using MoveNet / MediaPipe
- Keypoint detection and angle-based motion analysis
- Feedback on common posture issues: elbow drop, head tilt, foot spacing
- Jetson-compatible and lightweight
- Modular design for easy extension
